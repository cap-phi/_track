## Daily Briefing

> Here's to the god of time.

I'm angry. At myself. When I see my peers excelling at what they do, I feel happy for them, truly. Partly because I aspire to become someone like them, and partly because I can feel the joy through their work. But deep inside, I feel some kind of agony arising from another me looking down and mocking me for what I am right now. I used to blame others for my own mistakes as if by doing so, I would dust away the guilt and move. Of course, this naive image is very so biased that I feel astonished and ashamed when I look back on past experiences. It's normal to reflect on the past and try to figure out what's wrong when one gets unsatisfied with the present. Here I am, being that normal guy, and update what's going on in a place like github.

The growup world grants one with more freedom at the price of bearing the hard truth of finding out about oneself. The fantasy world's long gone, and the only way to go is forward.

I chose to come to Australia originally to escape the reality of unbearable competitions back in China. The crowd are pushing you like a hurricane regardless of who you are. Ambitions got crushed by bureaucratics, and progresses were flooded by trifling matters. That was what I felt when I graduated from one of my dream universities. From time to time, I looked at the society acting like a unopen cola, tumbling upside down with bubbles foaming up inside. With a little twist in the lid, the liquid would explode out of control. I was one of the bubbles trying to breath ouside of the bottle. I was blinded, and I wanted to see something different.

One of the biggest problems existing in the career advice the university is giveing you for is that they assume in advance that you are an Australian, or that you are comfortable in the current labour market, or at least familiar with the situations. There are a huge gap between the fresh out of school and the real job market, and this is especially true for international students hoping to live in Australia. From what I am standing, the first and foremost aspect of job seeking is that I actually have little experiences in knowing and blending in the job market. Communication matters. But no one is willing to take in someone who has somewhat different cultural background, thus making it harder to communicate. We see this too often: security clearance is required/PR is required/Australians only. Only after sorting this first invisible problem out, can I as an international student get to explore what my options are.

Usually, if I spend an hour or some time on the internet without further details, this means I'm most likely wasting my time and acting lazy. This has to change, not because I have nothing to do, but because I have tons of things to make up for. So, by confronting the problems instead of escaping the realities and pitying, the right thing to do is to restart right now.

Drive carefully, and do not rush. Rather take the long way around, than rush into an accident.
Should've spent time reading or writing instead of going over watched films before sleep. No easy way to do it, so I'll just cut to the chase: delete all irrelevant videos and apps, and keep only the books.

#### Refelection

Need to go over the notes and extract key info. Or it's forgotten.
The section leetcode is going like planned; the textbook reading is on its way to make two hours a day with more satisfaction and less agony.
However, the blogging part is somewhat struggling, with most time spent on keeping a journal of what's going on during the whole day. The original idea is that it's a good way to share coding tips and motivate myself. But it's not going well as planned. Been thinking about giving time to write notes for the textbook to help me go over keynotes later. It's a more practical though narrower way of blogging. But give it a go!
The failure is that the one hour allocated for English reading doesn't work out. Maybe try this: try to read an article about a certain topic, and after reading it, try to comment based on my own experience. Maybe I can take a draft as a writing exercise and based on the notes, it's more organized for me to express myself. The whole process can be recorded via ~~TicTok~~_YouTube Live_, considering it offers unlimited upload space. The first book that comes to mind is [_Mr Jones' Rules For The Modern Man_](https://d.pr/aOe1bb). Quite a book to read, and it presents some personal and professional suggestions or stereotypes to argue with. So I'll give it a go, then!

New Year's Eve, stay at home.

The last part of C is hasty reading. Lack practice of pointers and pointer operations, should add some coding practice next round of reading.

Got caught up in leetcode, and my teeth ache which is distracting. Kinda like road rage against the codes... Can't be efficient and reasonable...

#### Notes/Mindmap

Trouble is that dynamic programming and some other techniques take time to master.

#### Refelection

Have to set a timer for each problem. Can't afford to work out all the problems all by myself. 30 mins tops, no extension.
Just be humble and peaceful and stay motivated.

Need to watch out for the long work and no play scenario, it'll take its toll if you do not take a break.

#### Refelection

To carry on the plan as planned, it is the will that matters. You want to rise, first you have to stand down and gain strength. I will not take laziness as an excuse. Two more hours of coding and one more of language. Stay up as long as you like, but be damn sure to stick to the plan.

Ah, come on man!

Procrastination... Do not have time for the CSAPP/Algo reading... It happens, and should make time for it, each with half an hour penalty.
SO on Friday, 1.5 hours of algo, and 1.5 hours of CSAPP, plus another 1 hour of Spring Boot.

#### Notes/Mindmap

Vim is a tool that sometimes addicting, although I'm not fluent at it yet... So many plugins catering to different possibilities and needs for anyone. It is not without a cost to set it up properly... OK, I'll get better at it sooner or later...
Take a day off, to recharge yourself, makes sense for me. So work for 6 days and take 1 day off suits me after all...

End of month. So much to do next.
If there is nothing to motivate you, just sleep for tomorrow. You'll at least get rid of an excuse of tiredness when doing your job by then.
