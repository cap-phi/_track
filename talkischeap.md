# The Wasted Time

The team really manages to deliver a viable prototype algorithm for their client even though their client is not so cooperative and responsive. Under limited resources and so much pressure, if the team can also take more initiatives and more risks by doing some experiments in parallel to develop the algorithm, I believe the team can really make a difference through rapid trials and errors, even with the minimum help from the client.

The team should improve their decision-making process by actively engaging themselves with both the client and themselves. On the one hand, even though the client is missing most of the time, the team can ask the tutor more often for advice. On the other hand, the decision log on GitHub was last updated on 12, April which shows that there may not be an active and efficient decision-making process during the last month. The team can improve by holding a small zoom meeting to share concerns and discuss solutions as a start point. When everyone is on the same page, the rest of the problem will be solved more efficiently by sound decision.

Although the team delivers a satisfying outcome with a good algorithm, in the end, one can notice that not everyone contributes to the final deliverable. To be fair, it is normal that there's a difference in contribution in teamwork, but the team always strive for a synergy inside to maximise the outcome. The team can try to meet offline as most team members are in Canberra right now to reach a consensus, then keep it up to work together during this difficult situation.

Despite the disappearance of the key stakeholder for most of the semester, the team manages to get the client on board near the end of the semester. The team utilised the valuable chances of meeting with the client to get thing sorted out. However, in terms of communication inside the team, there is a lot to improve for the future. As a start, the team should really call for a face-to-face meeting to reveal problems in the way they communicate with each other. Also, try to put in each other's shoes to understand and support each other.

The team try their best to make the project work under limited resources and so much pressure during the whole semester. They constantly update their refection document and upload the file to GitHub. It would be better if the team can adopt a more flexible way to reflect on themselves and the project, rather than just keep records of the suggestions and recommendations. For example, drawing some road maps and marking out some key components is a good way to visualise the reflection process.

The project outcome is satisfying in terms of the deliverables stated in the modified SOW. One thing the team can improve is the scheduling of both the online meeting and the on-campus meeting. It's not engaging enough when only two to three participants talk through the whole meeting while others are just listening or being silent without feedback. Maybe trying to break it down to a smaller meeting if it's online and schedule it more often to encourage involvement. Maybe everyone can try to turn the camera on and speak up more often.

In terms of effective decision making, the team should seek more productive and proper ways to communicate with each other before deciding the matter. For instance, the instant messaging app is flexible but it is usually not a productive way for a good decision-making process as not everyone is well prepared for a thoughtful discussion under pressure from instant messaging. The same applies to phone calls and any other quick decision making processes. One way to get around it is to change the way we make decisions. Voting by the majority is in essence a flawed way for reaching a sound and well-thought decision. The team needs to engage a more professional way for stakeholders to thoroughly express their opinions before reaching any conclusion, even though the time cost may be higher.

The team member supports each other to deliver the outcomes to the customers throughout this semester. Every team member can benefit a lot more in cooperating with each other by using some industry-standard tools like git and Trello. Although it takes a lot of efforts to master these tools, I believe any ambitious team should at least try to use these tools to streamline the workflow. IM tools for teamwork are really outdated and I suggest we stay away from IM tools as soon as possible. We can start using Slack more often with various plugins, and for the coding, try to take advantage of the git branch, rebase, cherry-pick, tag commands more often to boost up the efficiency.

In terms of communicating with the client, the team really shows everyone that it is such an enjoyable process when both the team and the client are actively communicating with each other to achieve a common goal. The team utilises every tool at hand (i.e. slack, email, zoom, face-to-face meeting, collaboration website, etc...) to communicate with the client, and the client is also dedicated to improving the design of the website and database. Both are highly motivated by the same goal, therefore the synergy is also benefiting the whole communicating process.

The team does a fairly decent job trying to reflect on the performance during the whole semester in terms of setting up dedicated pages on Confluence and revising the audit according to the feedback. However, the thing is that the team is passively adopting this feedback to reflect, meaning that only after stakeholder point out a problem does the team begin to take actions. The team should take initiatives to improve teamwork and performance in order to really reflect and truly progress. The viable ways are holding extra seminars within the group to exchange opinions and challenge each other in a friendly way.

[Handover] Thanks, mate!

Regarding the recommendations, first of all, the team needs to adopt a more authoritative style to cope with the delay. Meanwhile, the CEO should require that the development team adjust the project plan without sticking to original roadmap.

Relevant documents should be provided and updated by the development team responsively.

For example, to keep the key stakeholders informed, the team should provide the CEO with a weekly status report. In this way, if the tecnical debt starts to build up, it can be spotted early on and therefore kept under control.

On the other hand, to effectively neutralize conflicts, the use of ethical project management by providing a team charter for example is highly recommended. In this way, the team can effciently avoid conflicts as much as possible and speed up the development process.

Next, both the team and the CEO should adjust their roles in agile methodology. For instance, the project manager should take on the role as a scrum master to supervise the progress in software development. In the meantime, the CEO should engage more with the team as the product owner, which helps prioritize the decisions and provide valuable feedback to guide the project towards success.

Last but not least, communication is of vital importance to the successful release of the software in any stage of development. Instead of waiting for each other to visit, proper communication channels should be set up to engage everyone more proactively in this project.

There will always be changes in the process, but agile software development encourages flexible responses to change. For example, the development has delayed the third release for three months now due to the lack of supply of new hardwares. To deal with this kind of unexpected circumstances, we can adjust the priorities in our user story map, or treat the new changes as the new stories and move on from there.

Next my team mate Yuliang will summarize our presentation.
