Critical thinking is not what you can acquire by just enchanting this mantra. It needs trials and errors and the patience to find out the truth. Take today for example, the tutor actually misguided me, costing me two more extra hours. Had to go over the doc and webpages again and try to do some trials to rule out the possibilities.

### More to add

Hang in there!

Feeling ashamed that I cannot even explain the CNN towards the end of this semester. Gonna catch up with it or I'll be damned...

Need to focus more on NNDL and computer organization.

By the way, need to build up my portfolio in the website and integrate projects into it.

### More to add

I don't know if I've made the right choice to come here in Australia instead of USA. But without hard works, I'll never find out. This is day 1 of a new start. Tian, go for it and feed all your anger, pain into the fire to burn brighter.

Here, a typical day should at leave allocate 2 hours for reading, 2 hours for coding, 2 hours for a certain task, and 2 hours of learning.

If you are hungry, eat; tired, sleep; bored, hang in there no excuse; smug, think about the failures; depressed, don't think, just code...

Every day is a new day which is the same for everyone in the world. The difference is how one uses the time to create value, or to invest in himself. Remember, the time lost is gone forever. Imagine that if you waste 30 minutes every day wactching some soap opera, then 180 hours are wasted in a year, which is equal to almost a whole 7 24h days' time. What a shame! On the other hand, if you dedicate 30 minutes to reading, then you can finish up at least 3 thick textbooks in a year. Your choice. Again, the more agony you endure now, the more valuable it is for your personal growth. I've committed the crime of a wasted life of 30 years, I don't want to repeat the mistakes anymore. I have to pay the price though, which means that I'm still poor and miserable right now. But it all starts once you face the hard truth of yourself. You are not special, until you put all your efforts in.

Today is Mother's Day.
