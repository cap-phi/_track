It doesn't matter whether you stay at home or go to somewhere else, because the place is the last thing to worry about as long as it fits, e.g., quiet, focused place just suits me fine. Nobody is supervising you or paying you for the work you do, so the only guy sweating and swearing is yourself. At the end of the day, only you have a saying of the efforts you put into the work. If you feel like wasting time, then you have to change. If you feel exhausted, then you know you have no regret for the day.
