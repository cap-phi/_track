# How to track both short and long term tasks?

> Still disoriented when facing overwhelming daily tasks.

My naive thought is to use a table like the following:

| Due Date |  Task   | sub-tasks |   10%    | 20% | 30% | 40% | 50% | 60% | 70% | 80% | 90% | 100% | Results | Feedback |
| :------: | :-----: | :-------: | :------: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :--: | :-----: | :------: |
|  08-04   | Workout |           | &#10003; |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |      |         |          |
|          |         |           |          |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |      |         |          |

and update the status every day. But is this viable in the long run?
