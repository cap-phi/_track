#### Refelection

Can't afford the casual lifestyles any more, or it'll cost me my memory, and health.
Return to normal time schedule: 6am to 11pm.
Typical day:

- Morning:
  - 6.5 - 8: prep; breakfast; making sandwiches; drive to campus;
  - 8 - 12: part 1
- Afternoon:
  - 12 - 16: part 2
  - 16 - 20: part 3
- Evening:
  - 20 - 22: drive back; dinner; workout; recording;
  - 22 - 23.5: reading; fall asleep.

But if there are errands needed to be run during limited daylight time, so be it. Just don't waste any more adjusting your time schedule for that. For example, tomorrow I need to change my Chinese driver licence for Australian licence, but Access Canberra opens at 9, so I have to go there by 9, and go through with it, then return to normal routine. Don't think about groceries on my way to Belconnen which seems to save time, in fact, just grab your groceries on your way home from 20 to 22. Another example is that sometimes the movie starts at 17 or 19.5, so be it. A little break won't hurt. The important thing is that, when you work, you really work, nothing else, so that the break is all yours to enjoy.

I can't multi-task... Also, I have a lot to catch up in neural networks, website design and database implementation... It's not mentally healthy when I haven't read a book for several days... Feels fuzzy and funny, man.

The thing is that I've lost my sleep for so long that I see it as a luxury to fall asleep even when it's broad daylight.
No argue with sleep. Sleep whenever you want, and sleep while you can. It's my top agenda over anything else.

How to manage a team? I should use monday.com?? It's a huge screw-up in uni setup where students don't even recognize the cooperations of the project which, to be honest, is usually out of date and non-practical.

wasted on game addiction. just facts, and regrets and angry at myself. it's a betrayal of my own promise, and it's only been three months since I made a deal with myself. time to strive and understand, because this pattern is so obvious and devastating that if forgotten time and time again, the tragedy becomes the parody where the leading role bears all the disgrace.

#### Refelection

#### Notes/Mindmap

[^1703]: What does it mean when I write down break or void? Usually, I cannot recall the instances during that period of time or it is sth trivial and not worth taking notes of. But this time, I use break to reflect on the fact that I already sink down to a position where the lectures/tutorials can contribute little to my understanding of the course. In this case, I try to avoid the 8420 tutorial because I find it difficult to follow and painful to just listen to tutors blathering about jargons. I do, however, feel for them because most of them are only doing this for the referral letter of the stipends rather that for imroving the understanding or enjoying this course. Students' learning outcomes become the byproduct of this tutorial. It is what it is, so deal with it. How can I tell? You can always tell if a man is enjoying his time or not, so to speak.
[^r]: Reading, mostly textbooks in related cs fields.
